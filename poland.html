				Collaborators: Arista Jusuf and Joy Ortiz
			</p>
			<p>
				Historically, Silesia was a region that spanned across nations, carrying with it a rich tradition of handicraft and building. This creative identity has been lost due to a long history of European conflict. The Silesian Museum is the only repository of that cultural past, though the local pride for this history is still present in today’s contemporary furniture industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our proposal is to revitalize the art of handicraft. Bzionkow will become a satellite of the Silesian Museum, designed for experimentation and exploration of this creative history. To connect Bzionkow back to its historical international context, Wroclaw – the new cultural capital of the European Union in 2016 – will become a launching point for the site’s inauguration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bzionkow’s buildings hold a richness expressed in their materials and construction. Our interventions and renovations will empathize with the site by reflecting old structures within their new counterparts. A series of phases will transform the site’s temporary role as a branch of Wroclaw 2016 into a center for culture and craft connected the Silesian Museum. Bzionkow will then become a place where past and present ideas of “handicraft” can be discussed through new works of art.

				Our proposal is to revitalize the art of handicraft by transforming Bzionkow into a center for exploring craft and bringing back the craft culture that was once the pride of Silesia.
			</p>
			<p>
				The European Union makes sure to acknowledge Europe not as nations with borders, but as a series of nodes, all of which have something unique to value. Our site is located in the region of Silesia, an area that is not defined by national borders and holds a history of craft that has now been lost to history.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, the region still specializes in furniture and takes pride in it even if it is only machine craft. Our goal is to take this pride and propel it forward, providing a space for craft to be rediscovered and Silesian pride to be harbored.
			</p>

			<p>
				To achieve this goal we will connect Bzionkow to pivotal groups in the short term and in the long term. Bzionkow will serve as a satellite for Wroclaw, the European Capital of Culture for 2016 and will connect to the Silesian Museum to serve in the way that MoMA is a place to exhibit art and MoMA PS1 serves as an exploratory venue for artists.

				Bzionkow, Our site is  comparable in scale to Cornell’s Arts Quad or even the piazza at the vatican. This means that it can have immense influence if we let it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s composed of almost a dozen buildings in different states of disrepair, each of which tells you about the site’s story and reveals how deeply ingrained in history Bzionkow is.

				The estate grew and shrank over time, directly affected by important events in history and is strongly affected by the changes in national borders it experienced.

				It’s our belief that the buildings of our site reflect this history and this richness in their textures, in the craft that created them.
			</p>
			<p>
				 We analyzed the varying states of disrepair of the buildings and concluded that only some of them were immediately habitable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The floor areas and the ways the rooms area already arranged gave us clues to how much and how quickly the site can begin to accommodate visitors.

				The project will take place in a series of phases. Wroclaw 2016 is an immediate event that will activate the site immediately and it will then be built upon to accommodate for more people as Bzionkow integrates itself more as a satellite to the Silesian Museum and generates its own identity.

				We will be creating an immediate structure to be built quickly and efficiently and be ready soon. The surrounding buildings will not just be exhibition spaces, they will be exhibitions themselves. As the phases continue the surrounding buildings will be slowly restored to working order and used to house people, give them spaces to work, cafes, etc. slowly making the transition from old and programless to cherished and full of acivity while our original building grows sparser and emptier, effectively switching the roles of the new and the old buildings.
